    "# The Ray Tracer Challenge\n",
    "## A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer\n",
    "### by James Buck\n",
    "\n",
    ">Brace yourself for a fun challenge: build a photorealistic 3D renderer from scratch! It’s easier than you think. In just a couple of weeks, build a ray tracer that renders beautiful scenes with shadows, reflections, brilliant refraction effects, and subjects composed of various graphics primitives: spheres, cubes, cylinders, triangles, and more. With each chapter, implement another piece of the puzzle and move the renderer that much further forward. Do all of this in whichever language and environment you prefer, and do it entirely test-first, so you know it’s correct. Recharge yourself with this project’s immense potential for personal exploration, experimentation, and discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening quote from the beta ebook copy, September 2018. Publication due November 2018 (now February 2019). For details, see\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will serve as a software definition of the ray tracer described in the above book. Code developed in earlier notebooks will be organized, documented and optimized. The workspace exported from this notebook can be used in the test cases defined in the book or used with a set of demonstration scenes associated with each chapter of the book.\n",

    "## Conventions\n",
    "Some of the functions called for in this book are quite simple, and needn't actually be coded as separate functions. The code within them could easily be inserted directly into where the functions are used. To denote this, simple substitutable functions will be referred to as Macros in the function description list. The APL function names will for the most part be the same as those given in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structures defined in the book will be represented by nested vectors. For each element of the vector data structure a constant will be defined whose value is the index of the element. These constants will be defined in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "*object* _ **attribute**\n",
    "\n",
    "This indexing form will be used throughout, in test cases and in functions. When the code is ready for optimization then the named indices will be replaced by integers."

    "## Development Approach\n",
    "This is my third time through the book to produce a ray tracer in Dyalog APL. In this notebook I'll take the code developed in the previous test driven development approach and try to organize and standardize the code. I've managed to work my way up to Chapter 15 of the book, but not all of the functionality in that chapter was completed. I took a quite different approach to Groups defined in Chapter 14. Although Triangles were implemented in Chapter 15, a complete parsing of OBJ 3D files was not completed. Chapter 16, Constructive Solid Geometry was the last remaining chapter, and has not yet been attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've noted the main problem with the book *The Ray Tracer Challenge* in earlier notebooks. The author develops code and data structures in an iterative fashion which can result in changes to data structures and functions. This in turn can force earlier tests to be rewritten to accomodate changes in function signature. I've decided now to consolidate what has been written into something that is well documented and more understandable on its own. I'll place all of the Chapter tests in a separate notebook for code validation, just as the Demo programs were put in a separate notebook in the last iteration through the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach I plan to take this time through is to divide the code notebook into three main sections;\n",
    "\n",
    "- A ***Data Structures*** section that deals with the basic object representations in the ray tracer\n",
    "- A ***Library Functions*** section devoted to functions that operate on the ray tracer data structures, and\n",
    "- A ***Ray Tracer Program*** section that defines the ray tracer processing code itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the data structure and library functions for ray tracer scenes separate would be worthwhile because of the way the author emphasized an object-oriented approach to developing the ray tracer. Dyalog APL supports OO programming so keeping these together would make an OO rewrite easier. The data structures and library functions themselves will still be in their separate sections but they will be kept together within each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the functions defined here in this notebook are described in some detail in the *Ray Tracer Challenge* book and the pseudo-code for most functions can be found in the Test Cases notebook."

    "## Lessons\n",
    "Here's a good place to keep track of things I learn about APL along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I was delighted to discover that you can do arithmetic with enclosed arrays (seems I've forgotten the definition of a scalar function!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to that I would generally disclose, perform the processing then enclose the result. What I found in the **prepare_computations** function was that I could do the following two expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   Z[hit_point] +← Z[hit_normalv]×EPSILON ⍝ Added for acne\n",
    "   Z[hit_reflectv]← R[ray_direction] reflect Z[hit_normalv]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The five values in the above two expressions are all enclosed values in nested vectors. Neat! I'll have to review my old code and fix it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I discovered that def'ns are tail recursive; Great news!\n",
    "This may be a means of implementing the recursive limit on calls without the RECURSE external variable, or at least something that can be used in the future.\n",
    "\n",
