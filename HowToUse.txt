How To Use

Start by loading the SALT files (*.dyalog) for the RayTracer and
RTDemo namespace. Use your own path to these files in the commands

]load C:\...\rtcode_ws
]load C:\...\rtdemo_ws
)copy dfns time         Optional if you'd like to time rendering
⎕PATH←'#.RayTracer'

To generate an image in one of the demo namespaces, change to the
namespace first, the do the commands

)CS RTDemo.Chapter11
im← w render c   (or use im← w render #.time c for timing)
ppm← canvas_to_ppm ppm
'Chap11.ppm' savePPM ppm

All of the demo namespaces have the 'w' and 'c' variables that
represent the scene world of lights and objects ('w') and the
camera ('c'). The above commands, with an appropriate change to
the demo namespace name and output file name will work in any of
the demo namespaces.

When you've finished a rendering and have saved the result to a
PPM image file, you can view the file with a suitable program such
as GIMP. If you are going to save the workspace for later, you may
want to get rid of the large intermediate variables before saving

)ERASE im ppm
